# Intro
This documentation section will cover on our TTGit service, along with our services we host for it. For more support on this service or would like help on it, go to the forums and submit an issue on the problem you are having.

## What it is
TTGit is a Devopps platform, made in a Go based program called forgejo, while is covered by Gitea on the inside. When you are using, it's basicly like GitHub, but more user-friendly. It mostly has the same features like most other Git source providers, but also offers extra services for it.

## How it works
It works almost the same way, like when you want to host your source code on platforms like this one. Your data is protected by Cloudflare in the background, while your source code or other data is stored in the cloud.
